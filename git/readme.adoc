List the current configured remote repository for your fork.

    $ git remote -v
    > origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
    > origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)

Specify a new remote upstream repository that will be synced with the fork.

    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git

Verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork.

    $ git remote -v
    > origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
    > origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)
    > upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
    > upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (push)

Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the upstream repository. Commits to master will be stored in a local branch, upstream/master.

    $ git fetch upstream
    > remote: Counting objects: 75, done.
    > remote: Compressing objects: 100% (53/53), done.
    > remote: Total 62 (delta 27), reused 44 (delta 9)
    > Unpacking objects: 100% (62/62), done.
    > From https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY
    >  * [new branch]      master     -> upstream/master

Check out your fork's local master branch.

    $ git checkout master
    > Switched to branch 'master'

Merge the changes from upstream/master into your local master branch. This brings your fork's master branch into sync with the upstream repository, without losing your local changes.

    $ git merge upstream/master
